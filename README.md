## Overview 

Blog is a fully functional blog management web app, which is built using laravel v10.0 as a backend framework, used tailwing v2.0 and alpine.js v3.0 for handling frontend stuff.
It can manage posts, with some great functionality like WYSIWYG text editor, save as draft feature, dynamic filtering options with search and category dropdown.
